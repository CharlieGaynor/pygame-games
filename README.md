A collection of games I made with pygame!


-------------
Tic Tac Toe
-------------
- Tic Tac Toe vs either a perfect bot or a friend 
- Bot trained by myself, via reinforcement learning. See other repository (tic tac toe) for this
- Not the most fun, but looks kinda nice
----------------
Family Fortunes
----------------
- Remake of the popular tv show we all know and love
- Grab a host and two teams and you're off
- See text file inside for controls

----------
Countdown
----------
- The famous countdown come to life
- No senior bus pass required to play
- Even includes a conundrum, you lucky bugger

------------
Only Connect
------------
- Again based on a TV show
- Incredibly difficult, likely to only score significantly in the last round
- Fun to watch your friends be baffled
- Requires a host and two willing teams

-----------
Memory Game
-----------
- See how good your memory game is with this interactive memory game
- Actually forms part of a general assessment for ADD
- It even records your scores in a csv, including the date and hour you completed it
- Complete over a long period of time to see if you can increase your short term memory capacity (hint: you can)!
